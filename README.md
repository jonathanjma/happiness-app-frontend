# Happiness App Frontend

This is the second version of the Happiness App frontend. We have refactored the code base to use TypeScript and Vite, as well as follow the new design!

## Run steps:

- Change directory of terminal to `happiness-frontend`.
- Run `npm install`
- Add a `.env` file to the root directory, add a value for VITE_BASE_API_URL
- To start the frontend, run `npm run dev`
